## 🚀 About
This repository contains a collection of **Java assignment programs and projects** that I’ve implemented while learning and practicing core Java concepts. It includes solutions for exercises based on fundamentals like control structures, OOP, data handling, and more.

The code here represents hands-on practice with Java programming to deepen understanding of syntax, logic, and object-oriented design.

This repository includes assignments such as:
- Basic Java syntax and program examples
- Conditional logic and looping
- Functions/methods

- Arrays and collection usage
- Exception handling
- File input/output (if included)


## 🧠 Objectives
These assignments help with:
- Strengthening fundamentals of Java
- Understanding core OOP principles
- Practicing problem solving and coding logic
- Preparing for advanced Java and backend development

## 📂 Folder Structure
Each assignment folder/file is a separate Java program covering a specific topic or requirement.
